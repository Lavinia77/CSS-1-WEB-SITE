        <h3>Leadership</h3>
        <p>Leaders are typically the figureheads of an organization and for good reason. Workers depend on a strong management team to coordinate and ensure that everyone else knows their job role.

          Top 5 skills that i have been given positve feedback from my organization are:

        <ol>1.Communication: I love to listen to people I work with and understand their point of view.</ol>
        <ol>2.Awareness: Being aware of why your team is not responding to your guidance is very important and should adreess it accordingly.</ol>
        <ol>3.Honesty/Integrity: Great leaders are not exclusively those who solely get results. Rather, leaders must also command respect and trust by being forthright with their employees and the greater industry of which they are a part. Teams may
          not always like what a leader has to say, but if the message is honest, they will often appreciate knowing the truth, rather than being fed lies and excuses. Ideally, a strong leader should also possess the ability to deliver harder truths
          diplomatically so as not to alienate workers.</ol>
        <ol>4.Relationship Building: For some people, it may seem like business is primarily about some form of production. However, production can proceed more efficiently when team members trust and work well with each other. In this sense,
          business is about networking and relationships. It is a leaderâ€™s role to encourage healthy working relationships between team members, clients, producers, other managers and the community at large. When employees trust each other and the
          business as a whole, the entire organization stands to benefit significantly.</ol>
        <ol>

          5.Innovation: Strong leaders are typically creative and recognize when changes could improve the workflow. As well-planned as a business process can be, it will inevitably encounter some obstacle to overcome. An innovative leader is someone
          who takes responsibility for these obstacles and creates a path toward bringing the work back to its intended expectation.</ol>

        <h3>Data science</h3>
        <p>I have the ability to solve problems, and the most I am passionate about is:
        <ol>1.Python</ol>
        <ol>2.Java</ol>
        <ol>3.TensorFlow</ol>
